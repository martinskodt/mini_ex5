### Rules of my program
Rule 1: balls have bounce of the sides.
Rule 2: balls bounce of each other.
Rule 3: balls change color every time the bounce of each other.
Rule 4: balls can be added to the system.

### The generativity of "Bouncing Balls"
The program only have a narrow purpose to be aestheticly pleasing for the eye. Together with being interactive, in the way that you can addapt the system to your personal prefrence of amount of balls. In this program, i as the programmer does not have a crystal clear image, of how the program is gonna look like when i start the program. in the program ther are too many moving parts for me to keep track of on the same time. My logic in the code is not the only thing that determens what the program looks like. The computers execusion of my "commands" determens the direction of the balls, start points, colors of the balls and speed. So that they collectivly, give a wider impression that my code could on its own. The different variables always give diffrent visuals every time.
